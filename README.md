# Seating-Chart-App

This app allows users to organize guests at tables based by the guests' preferences for who they want/don't want to sit next to, their tier (priority), Job/Position, and themes.

The app is based off of Weding Seating Planners and can be used for any type of event.

The app was originaly developed with C++ but later converted to Python due to the use of OpenPyxl. To see the lastest version of the code, click on the *Python Version (MOST UPTO DATE)* folder.

**NOTE:** The app currently only works on Windows

Please download the latest release and read the instructions on how to run the app.
